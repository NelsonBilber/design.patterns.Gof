#Prototype

Instanciate a class by cloning the properties of an existing object.</br>
Deep copy: clones main object and child objects. </br>
Shallow copy: duplicates all object's properties, including reference, including referencess. </br>
</br>

Shallow copies duplicate as little as possible. A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the collection structure, not the elements. With a shallow copy, two collections now share the individual elements.
</br>
Deep copies duplicate everything. A deep copy of a collection is two collections with all of the elements in the original collection duplicated.
