#Behavioural Patterns

How object communicate between them.


* **Chain-of-responsibility: **
Pass the request along the chain until and object handlers it.

* **Command: **
Encapsulate a request from the invoker in objects
Object-oriented replacement for callbacks

* **Interpreter: **
Define a grammar for instructions that form a part of a language or notation, allowing the grammar to be easily extended.

* **Iterator: **
Standard interface for traversing a collection without the need to understand the underlying structure

* **Mediator: **
Encpasulate how a set of objects interact. Intermediary to decouple many peers.

* **Memento: **
Controls the comunication between two entities storing state of an object to use in future.

* **Observer: **
Check when object states changes and all dependent objects are notified

* **State: **
Change the object behaviour when internal state change.

* **Strategy: **
Encapsulate similar algorithms on a class an choose them in runtime.

* **TemplateMethod: **
Similar to Strategy pattern but we could define steps with individual implementations

* **Visitor: **
Separates a set of structured data from functionaliy that may be performed uppon it. It separates an algorithm from an object strucutr on which it operates.
