#Structural patterns

Solutions about object composition, interfaces, ..., how to define relationships between class 

* **Adapter: **
When an existing class, and its interface does not match
Reuse a class that cooperates with unrelated classes

* **Bridge: **
It aims to decouple interface from implementation
C++ is also known as Pimpl (pointer to implementation)

* **Composite: **
Create hierarchical objects into tree structures.
Group of objects treated in the same way as single instance of an object.


* **Decorator: **
Change the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting the existing functionality of the objects.

* **Facade: **
Interface for simplify comunications with complex objects

* **Flyweight: **
Optimize resources when working with a very large number of objects

* **Proxy: **
Adds a level of indirection for most complex tasks. Is works as an interface for something else.
